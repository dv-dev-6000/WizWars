## The Game

This project was created with Monogame in c# for an Object Oriented Programming module as part of the Edinburgh College Game Development HND course.
The aim was to create a local multiplayer 2D Bomberman clone, themed after wizards duelling with potions. 

The game requires controllers and supports between 2-4 players. Players can drop potions to destroy brick blocks which may drop upgrades, the aim is for players to blast their way to their opponents and blow them up without getting blown up themselves, each player has 3 lives and the last player standing wins. 

Upgrades include:

* Speed Boost
* Extra Cauldrons
* Extended Range
